# About Me
I am a third-year undergraduate in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.illinois.edu) at the [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](https://www.illinois.edu), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Han Zhao](https://hanzhaoml.github.io/) and [Prof. Arindam Banerjee](https://arindam.cs.illinois.edu/) in studying the theoretical foundations of machine learning. Currently, I work on:
- **Transfer Learning/Generalization:** Generalization theory and algorithms for the non i.i.d. setting.
- **Deep Learning Theory:** Understanding the dynamics of neural network optimization techniques and their impact on generalization performance.


## Publications
