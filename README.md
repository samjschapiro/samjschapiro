# About Me

*Note: I will be visiting the [Simons Institute for the Theory of the Computing](https://simons.berkeley.edu/homepage), [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) to study [Modern Paradigms in Generalization](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/modern-paradigms-generalization) during Fall 2024.*

I am a senior undergraduate at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.illinois.edu), [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](https://www.illinois.edu), where I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Han Zhao](https://hanzhaoml.github.io/) and [Prof. Arindam Banerjee](https://arindam.cs.illinois.edu/) on advancing the theoretical foundations of machine learning. My current focus is on:
- **Transfer Learning:** Theory and algorithms for modern generalization settings.
- **Deep Learning Theory:** Studying the interplay between optimization algorithms and generalization for neural networks.
